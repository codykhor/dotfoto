# DotMedia

DotMedia is a video format converter application that intends to provide an easy process for users to convert videos to mp4 format and it accepts a range of video file types. The application supports a straightforward process from uploading to downloading the final output. Converted video does not contain any watermarks and available to be downloaded through a simple click on the ‘download’ button.

The application is a university group project for Cloud Computing. It is developed using Express and Node.js along with cloud services provided by the university and hosted on AWS to provide public access and uses persistence services such as S3 bucket and SQS. File upload on the application is done by using pre-signed URL for security and minimize load on server. The application is also configured to scale automatically according to incoming requests.

Cloud services may no longer be available due to unit completion and revoked access.
